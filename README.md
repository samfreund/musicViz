# My music taste, by the numbers

An interactive visualization and statistical analysis of my music library. As I use Jellyfin, the parsing is a bit different from the original project.

To use this project with your own Jellyfin library, you will need to set the following before running `update_data.py`:
```
JELLYFIN_URL
JELLYFIN_API_KEY
JELLYFIN_USER_ID
```
